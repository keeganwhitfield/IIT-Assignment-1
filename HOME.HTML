    <P>I am Keegan Whitfield, 
    <P>My initial interest of IT stemmed from my love of video gaming left me yearning to understand technology further. Specifically, what effort had gone into creating this colourful wonderland. 
    <P>It was 1994, my father had brought home our first home computer, we did not know much about computers ourselves at that time, so my father asked a colleague of his to assist him with the initial hardware installation, it had been pre-assembled, and the software had been pre-installed, we were not that adventurous just yet. I remember my father proudly telling me that our Intel Pentium PC put the computers at school to shame. And then, like most cliché kids with an interest in IT, I turned to comics and anime, so now in my spare time, I build plastic Gundam models. Here’s some I prepared earlier in Figure 1 and Figure 2.
