    <P> I’ve never had to do a personality test before; I certainly understand the concept and why employers would be interested in their results, such as those in figure 5
    <P>

    <P> Figure 5
    <P> The Mind section makes sense, I’ve known I was introverted for some time now. The Energy section is interesting, I would have said I was more observant than intuitive. Nature, I suppose I tend to spend a large amount of time coming to grips with a decision. Identity, I would agree that I can be a little all over the place at times.
       I think what this means is that in a team, I’m likely to conform with confident members regardless of whether their decision is best of the team. 
       This doesn’t mean I can only work in teams with a single confident member, it means if there are too many confident members, I’m going to be too busy playing “Mediator” attempting to align ideas, rather than contributing to the project.
    <P>
    <P> I was interested to complete a Learning Style Test, as I though my learning style was a little chaotic.

    <P> Figure 6
    <P> So, it’s confirmed, I learn best by doing, I really am amazed by people who aren’t wired the same way. With the last few people hired on in my workplace, our manager has insisted on teaching our radio operators out of a book first for two weeks before bringing them into the operational environment. Maybe they were Kinaesthetic learners too.
    When working in a team, I can learn from having other explain things to me or simply watching others first. But at the end of the day, I’m going to have to sit down somewhere quiet and fiddle a for a bit myself before being able to contribute effectively.
    What this means going forward, is that while it’s probably not a good idea to have all members learn through doing, it would helpful me if there was at least one other Kinaesthetic learning styled member.
    <P>
    <P> I thought to myself that another personal test that may be relevant in the workplace would be and emotional Intelligence test. Simply put; the ability to read the outward emotions of others.

    <P> Figure 7
    <P> The result was better than expected. I tend to usually find myself in awkward positions in my current workplace, having misread a colleague’s emotions and saying something that is usually acceptable, but in this situation may be misconstrued as inappropriate. 
    As most of the team’s exchanges will probably be by way of text chat, this may not come into play in this project. However, should timings and resources allow for it, there may be the occasional face to face video chat.
    This should not influence the forming of the team. This short coming is something I must address myself. Having said that, should a misunderstanding occur as a result of misreading of a team members emotional state, it would be best to apologise in the first instance and inform the team of my shortfall in this area.
