    <P> My goal with this degree was always to build an easy-to-use application to assist in the scheduling of port resources for shipping movements in my home region of Gladstone. Specifically, marine pilot allocation to shipping movement. My application will analyse the previous allocations and determine the most efficient distribution to allow for greatest number of shipping movements in a forecasted twenty-four-hour period. The key factors it will take into consideration are pilot licence levels, rostered hours, and fatigue calculations. The shipping movements timings and other port resource allocations will be handled elsewhere, perhaps by other custom-built application in the future. 
    <P>Like many who study IT I came into the degree with aspirations of creating the next big thing in IT. However, a quick look around the internet showed me that all my “brilliant” ideas had been done, some in fact have been done for quite a while now. So how can I contribute to the IT community? I’ve since realised I that I’m focus on only one outcome, to contribute to only to the IT community. So why not bring the next big IT thing to another community. Thus, I’ve decided to look a like closer to home: To build an application to assist in the scheduling of maritime port resources. To someone from the outside the shipping community I can already hear them say’ “but Keegan, shipping has been around for a long time, surely there’s at least one scheduling and resource management tool already in existence”. But there isn’t, and certainly not one applicable to Gladstone. 
    <P>Gladstone is a complicated port. The shortest marine pilot duty is one and a half hours, this doesn’t include travel time to the vessel, as well as travel time back in the pilot transfer boat or helicopter, nor does it include the travel time back to their home or office. This blows out the shortest marine pilot job to two hours and fifty minutes. Like any operational duty, marine pilots are subject to fatigue and thus have strict rules around this, such as, they cannot work for more than eight hours continuously, they must have at least one uninterrupted ten-hour break, they cannot work more than twelve hours in a twenty-four period, just to name a few. Currently, marine pilots have had to check their fatigue using pen and paper calculations. Recently, an unofficial Microsoft Excel spreadsheet began being used by some pilots to determine if an individual pilot was within fatigue rules or not. This spreadsheet was developed by me, and it was always the first step to constructing a tool that could be us    ed to determine if all currently roster pilot, approximately eight to twelve every day, were within fatigue levels, and if not, how to better utilise them so that all requested port movement, which can be up to twenty in a twenty-four period, can be completed efficiently but more importantly, safely.
    <P>Many people would do aa quick calculation and say, “even if you only had eight pilots, and twenty port movements, half would do two jobs each and the other half would do three jobs, and really how hard is to drive a boat that can only do twelve knots at best”. Imagine taking a car driving student through Sydney CBD for five hours, having a two-hour break, then going for another five-hour session, taking another two-hour break, then going for another session three driving session. Each time you have a break you take thirty minutes to drive home, have an hour to yourself, thirty minutes back to your student. You do this for four day. Eventually you’re going to have an accident, and as the licenced driver, you will be the one at fault. This is the stress on a marine pilot.
    <P>The main concept of the program is to extract and analyse existing data from the Maritime Safety Queensland (MSQ) database, QSHIPS. This is the application where shipping agents inter details of their vessel and request port resources. From here, MSQ schedules the vessel accordingly based on port guidelines. It is at this point that port service providers allocate port resources to a vessel movement. If services are unavailable due to fatigue or insufficient resources, the applicable port resource manager will contact MSQ to request a revision of the scheduling time to a point where resources are available. My proposed application will greatly increase the efficiency of this process, by extracting the pilot allocation data regarding previous movements to determine current fatigue levels. This will accelerate the allocation process as a thorough analysis can take approximately thirty minutes. The application will then look ahead to the existing pilot allocations to determine if any changes could be made     to alleviate fatigue, so simply increase the efficiency of marine pilot usage. It is at this point that the application would determine which pilots are to be allocated to each vessel movement. The application would need to take into consideration marine pilot licence levels, as not all marine pilots are qualified to complete all vessel types or all vessel movements.
    <P>As this would be a deployable application, programming software would be required. At this time, I still remember some of the Visual C++ commands, however, I would not be averse to switching to a different language, should an alternative prove more effective. As this application would be deployed in a commercial environment, a fully licenced application compiler would be required prior to the applications completion and deployment. The only hardware requirements would be desktop computers to install the application compilers, as well as a separate set of computers to act as a test environment.
    <P>Obviously, programming skills are an essential requirement for this project, most people with an IT degree would have some experience with programming languages, . As previous stated, an application compiler such as Visual Studio is required, but as also mentioned earlier, it may not be this specific compiler. Most well-known compilers are available for online purchasing. Testing is an essential part of any project, and while experienced test would not be essential, it would be of great assistance prior to field deployment. If possible, it should be done by someone external of the project team.
