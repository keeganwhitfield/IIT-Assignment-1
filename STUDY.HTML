    <P>I’ve procrastinated enrolling in the degree for so long. I told myself that start this degree shortly after I complete my diploma of networking technology at the now defunct Computer Power Institute, but as always, life got in the way. Now, four years on after the successful completion of my diploma, it is time to move to the next level. When Open Universities Australia advised me that RMIT ran four terms a year as opposed to the usual format of two semesters and potential summer semester, I chose to enrol immediately. My thinking had been that if I could complete eventually increase my study load to two subjects a term, it would be similar to a full-time workload, and I could complete this degree well before I’m forty, rather than just after forty. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.
    <P>I mentioned that I have completed a diploma, but the problem with technology is its rapid advancements, even now, well into the twenty-first century. My goal is to update my network administration skills, my diploma focused mainly on the obsolete IPv4, it did cover a little of IPv6, but I’d like a refresher of sorts. I would also like to get into programming as a secondary skill, or even as a hobby.
